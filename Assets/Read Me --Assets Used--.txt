To ensure this file doesn't get massive and I don't put paid assets on a public Github repo I have not included some assets and are ignored in the gitignore.

To get this working download the following from the package manager:
-Candice AI for Games
-Fantasy Skybox FREE
-Sci-Fi Construction Kit (Modular)
-Octave3D-Level Design

Once they are in add them to "External Assets" folder and the game should run again :)
